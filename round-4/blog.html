                            As the Chairman of the Board of Trustees, I am forever confident and optimistic about where
                            our organisation is heading. We continue to invest in robust operating models, systems and
                            procedures. This has allowed us to launch and implement innovative and ambitious programmes
                            that are truly helping save lives on the ground. I, along with my fellow Trustees, have made
                            it our mission to ensure that our organisation maintains the highest levels of
                            accountability and transparency for our partners, donors and supporters.
