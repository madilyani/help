                                A fundamental pillar of faith incumbent upon Muslims who can afford it, Zakat is full of
                                fruitful benefits. This is an obligation that offers great blessings to both the giver
                                and receiver of the Zakat, as well as immense reward.
                            </p>

                                Not only does Zakat purify oneâ€™s wealth, it helps fight poverty and is an opportunity to
                                give to the less fortunate annually. Trust that with us, your Zakat will be used where
                                it is most needed. Be the reason for hope in the lives of those who are less fortunate.
                                Be the reason for sustainable change.

                                Sadaqah is a gift of charity that not only benefits others in this life but also
                                benefits the giver (you!) and their loved ones in the next. It is beautiful voluntary
                                Islamic concept of giving that is continuous and everlasting, a form of charity that
                                provides rewards for as long as people benefit.

                                poor and ensuring a better quality of life for all.
