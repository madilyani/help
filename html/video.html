                    Your Zakat Is An Obligation, Ensure It Is Fulfilled In Trust
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Zakat is the most basic form of charity in Islam – which is to be paid on an annual basis – used to
                    help those who are less fortunate within society. Being one of the five pillars of Islam, it is
                    obligatory for Muslims to pay 2.5% of their annual income as a part of fulfilling their Islamic
                    duties.
