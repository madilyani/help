                The war in Syria will be nine years old in March 2020 and remains one of the world‘s most complex
                humanitarian crises. Constant conflict has led to a sustained, constant erosion of livelihoods and
                communities, and the world’s biggest displacement crisis since the Cold War.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the West of Syria — while underreported in local and international news networks — the still-hot
                conflict between State-Affiliated Groups and ‘opposition’ actors continues, with a ground and air
                campaign leading to significant civilian casualties and the rendering of damage to crucial public
                services such as hospitals, schools & water networks.
            </p>
            <p>
                This almost decade long conflict has caused repeated, protracted levels of displacement, with millions
                of Syrians living as IDPs (Internally Displaced Persons) fleeing from the southern reaches of Idleb and
                Aleppo Governorates to the northern border with Turkey and many more forced to flee their country
                entirely to the relative refuge of neighbouring states, particularly Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon.
