                                    Gender mainstreaming is one of the most crucial considerations in which we ensure that our projects account for the unique vulnerabilities faced by people of all genders. Within our projects we ensure to treat everyone as equal as we know this is the first step to reducing poverty levels for all and achieving our vision.

                                    At Action for Humanity we understand the continuing pressures everyone is putting on the world and the environment and how this can cause the worst effects on the poorest people. We work to ensure all our projects are sustainable and work with these people who are most vulnerable to these increased environmental pressures.

                                   <p>
                                    The mainstreaming of safeguarding and protection is crucial to ensure no one is exposed to further harm and the affected populations are supported without discrimination. This includes both child protection and protection from gender-based violence.

                                    Following the global commitment of ‘leave no one behind’, we endeavour for inclusion of the most marginalised and vulnerable people in all our programmatic interventions.
